Capstone Project Introduction: AI Potential with Service Requests and Incidents

During our capstone project, we partnered with the City of Seattleâ€™s IT Department, which manages and resolves service requests and incidents through its service/help desk or Service Hub system. Given the volume and complexity of the generated data, extracting actionable insights to expedite stalled requests is a significant challenge. Our project aimed to transform this organizational process by embedding AI techniques into the system.

Leveraging Llama 2 with the LangChain framework, we developed a locally run chatbot, EVAN9000, designed to optimize operational efficiency while prioritizing data security. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrated its effectiveness, showcasing EVAN9000 as a promising solution for enterprise-level use cases.
